# Chapter 11 - Data is the new oil

## Theory

What is `prop drilling`?
What is `lifting the state up`?
What are `Context Provider` and `Context Consumer`?
If you `don't pass a value to the provider does it take the default value`?

## Coding

Practice `React Context with code examples`
Try out `Nested Contexts`
